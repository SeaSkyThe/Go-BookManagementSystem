# Go-BookManagementSystem
This project is intended to teach me how GO interacts with databases (MySQL in this case).

Remember to me: you have to install and configure MySQL in your machine (as well as the tables)


How to run:
- Go into cmd/main
- Run: go build
- Run: go run main.go
- Test with POSTMAN (https://www.postman.com/) and be happy
